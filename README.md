# placental-segmentation-2dunet

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and data for the training of 2d U-net models on placental blood vessel and maternal/foetal blood volume data. In addition separate notebooks allow the application of the trained U-net models to 3d blocks of image data in order to produce segmented outputs.
